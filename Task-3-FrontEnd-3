  combining the tiles with the same number to have a tile with the sum of the number on the two tiles.
•	After achieving the tile with a 2048 tile, players must be asked if he still wants to continue the game or wants to leave. 
•	Must not include complicated controls. The controls you will be providing are just upward, downward, and sideways.
  every time one moves a title, another tile must pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box.
